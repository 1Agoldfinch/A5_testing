# Assignment 5: Markdown and Software Libraries

## Report - Use Case 1
Finding an appropriate approach to solve this use case was quite simple. I started my research in chapter 11 of our official module materials and took a short look at table 11.1 again:
Here I immediately recognized that the correct package required for this case had to be ,,Shapely" because the task implies the ,,analysis of some geometric objects in a non-specific cartesian coordinate system''(WKT-format!!!). 

**In our case we had to determine the distance between the centroids of two polygons, whose coordinates are displayed in WKT-format. Therefore I identified the following steps necessary to complete the task by navigating through the official documentation site for Shapely 2.1.1 :**

- 1. loading the data from the WKT-strings correctly 
**(****module shapely.wkt ->[,,loads''-function](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)****)**

- 2. generating geometries based on this data
**(****module shapely.geometry ->,,Polygon''-class****)**

- 3. determining the centroids of the geometries
**(****,,.centroid''-attribute****)**

- 4. calculating the distances between them
 **(****,,.dsitance()''-method****)**

You must use Markdown to format your report (e.g. use code blocks (extended
syntax) and inline code formatting, links, headers and so on).

Which libraries did you use to solve the problem, and why?
• What methods and objects do these libraries offer for solving the task? Provide
concrete documentation links.
• Which alternative libraries did you consider, if any?
• What was your research process? What resources did you use?
• What challenges did you encounter during your research?

 When selecting a library, use the latest available version and clearly specify the
Python version and library version used.
