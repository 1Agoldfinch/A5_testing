## Report - Use Case 1
Finding an appropriate approach to solve this use case was quite simple. I started my research in chapter 11 of our official module materials and took a short look at table 11.1 again:
Here I immediately recognized that the correct package required for this case had to be ,,Shapely" because the task implies the ,,analysis of some geometric objects in a non-specific cartesian coordinate system(WKT-format). 

**In our case we had to determine the distance between the centroids of two polygons, whose coordinates are displayed in WKT-format. Therefore I identified the following steps necessary to complete the task:**

-loading the data from the WKT-strings correctly
-generating geometries based on this data
-determining the centroids of the geometries
-calculating the distances between them
