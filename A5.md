# Assignment 5: Markdown and Software Libraries

## Report - Use Case 1
Finding an appropriate approach to solve this use case was quite simple. I started my research in chapter 11 of our official module materials and took a short look at table 11.1 again:
Here I immediately recognized that the correct package required for this case had to be ,,Shapely" because the task implies the ,,analysis of some geometric objects in a non-specific cartesian coordinate system''(WKT-format!!!). Theoretically, this task could also be solved with ,,Geopandas'' (library) but the script-implementation would be a bit more complicated because ,,Geopandas'' mainly focuses on geospatial data whereas ,,Shapely'' exclusively addresses the processing of ,,spatially unbound'' geometries. For this reason ,,Shapely'' is the best choice for this case.

**In our case we had to determine the distance between the centroids of two polygons, whose coordinates are displayed in WKT-format. Therefore I identified the following steps necessary to complete the task by navigating through the official documentation site for Shapely 2.1.1.** 

**Please click the added links for further information/ documentation about the specific methods and objects mentioned here:**

1. <strong>loading the data from the WKT-strings and generating the geometries correctly</strong> 

   > **module shapely.wkt -> [,,`loads`''-function](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)**  
   > **module shapely.geometry -> [,,`Polygon`''-class](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon)**

2. <strong>determining the centroids of the geometries</strong>
   > **[,,`.centroid`''-attribute](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#object.centroid)**

3. <strong>calculating the distances between them</strong>
   > **[,,`.distance()`''-method](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#object.distance)**

### Script (Python):

```
{
from shapely.wkt import loads # Importing the loads-function from the shapely.wkt-module
from shapely.geometry import Polygon # Importing the polygon-class in order to create our desired polygon afterwards

# Determining the WKT-strings of our polygons
WKT_polygon1 = "POLYGON ((4.2 0, 1.3 4, -3.4 2.47, -3.4 -2.47, 1.3 -4, 4.2 0))"
WKT_polygon2 = "POLYGON ((46.2 0, 43.3 4, 38.6 2.47, 38.6 -2.47, 43.3 -4, 46.2 0))"

# Generating/ Loading the polygon-geometries out of our WKT-strings (,,loads''-function)
polygon1 = loads(WKT_polygon1)
polygon2 = loads(WKT_polygon2)

# Calculate the centroids of the polygons (,,.centroid''-attribute)
centroid1 = polygon1.centroid
centroid2 = polygon2.centroid

# Calculate the distance between the two centroids (,,.distance()''-method)
distance = centroid1.distance(centroid2)

print(f"The distance between the two centroids is: {distance}")
}
```
