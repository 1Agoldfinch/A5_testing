# Assignment 5: Markdown and Software Libraries

## Report - Use Case 1
Finding an appropriate approach to solve this use case was quite simple. I started my research in chapter 11 of our official module materials and took a short look at table 11.1 again:
Here I immediately recognized that the correct package required for this case had to be ,,Shapely" because the task implies the ,,analysis of some geometric objects in a non-specific cartesian coordinate system''(WKT-format!!!). Theoretically, this task could also be solved with ,,Geopandas'' (library) but the script-implementation would be a bit more complicated because ,,Geopandas'' mainly focuses on geospatial data whereas ,,Shapely'' exclusively addresses the processing of ,,spatially unbound'' geometries. For this reason ,,Shapely'' is the best choice for this case.

**In our case we had to determine the distance between the centroids of two polygons, whose coordinates are displayed in WKT-format. Therefore I identified the following steps necessary to complete the task by navigating through the official documentation site for Shapely 2.1.1.** 

**Please click the added links for further information/ documentation about the specific methods and objects mentioned here:**

1. <strong>loading the data from the WKT-strings and generating the geometries correctly</strong> 

   > **module shapely.wkt -> [,,`loads`''-function](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#shapely.wkt.loads)**
   > **module shapely.geometry -> [,,`Polygon`''-class](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon)**

2. <strong>determining the centroids of the geometries</strong>
   > **[,,`.centroid`''-attribute](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#object.centroid)**

3. <strong>calculating the distances between them</strong>
   > **[,,`.distance()`''-method](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#object.distance)**

### Script (Python):

```
{
from shapely.wkt import loads # Importing the loads-function from the shapely.wkt-module
from shapely.geometry import Polygon # Importing the polygon-class in order to create our desired polygon afterwards

# Determining the WKT-strings of our polygons
WKT_polygon1 = "POLYGON ((4.2 0, 1.3 4, -3.4 2.47, -3.4 -2.47, 1.3 -4, 4.2 0))"
WKT_polygon2 = "POLYGON ((46.2 0, 43.3 4, 38.6 2.47, 38.6 -2.47, 43.3 -4, 46.2 0))"

# Generating/ Loading the polygon-geometries out of our WKT-strings (,,loads''-function)
polygon1 = loads(WKT_polygon1)
polygon2 = loads(WKT_polygon2)

# Calculate the centroids of the polygons (,,.centroid''-attribute)
centroid1 = polygon1.centroid
centroid2 = polygon2.centroid

# Calculate the distance between the two centroids (,,.distance()''-method)
distance = centroid1.distance(centroid2)

print(f"The distance between the two centroids is: {distance}")
}
```

## Report - Use Case 2
The aim of this exercise was to find an efficient way to transfer the coordinates of a point into another reference coordinate system. In detail, we had to transfer the point's coordinates given in WKT-format ("POINT (114.17208 22.29345)") from EPSG:4326 (WGS84) to EPSG:2326 (HK80). Due to this fact and unlike in the first use case it is obvious that we have to use a library intended for the processing of geospatial data now. During my research I identified ,,GeoPandas'' as the library most suitable for this task although this case could theoretically also be completed with other options (like ,,Arcpy'' or ,,PyQGIS''). But I will go into that in more detail later.

**In the end I chose ,,GeoPandas'' and started to research on the official documentary-site for GeoPandas Version 1.1.1. The following steps are necessary to complete this use case (Again, please click the links for further information about the methods and objects used!):**

1. <strong>creating a GeoDataFrame and loading the point into it (based on the WKT-strings(EPSG:4326))</strong> 

   > **library geopandas -> [,,`GeoDataFrame`''-class](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html#geopandas.GeoDataFrame)**  
   > **module shapely.wkt -> [,,`loads`''-function](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)**

2. <strong>transforming our point into EPSG:2326</strong>
   > **[,,`.to_crs()`''-method](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs.html#geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs)**

### Script (Python):

You must use Markdown to format your report (e.g. use code blocks (extended
syntax) and inline code formatting, links, headers and so on).

Which libraries did you use to solve the problem, and why?
• What methods and objects do these libraries offer for solving the task? Provide
concrete documentation links.
• Which alternative libraries did you consider, if any?
• What was your research process? What resources did you use?
• What challenges did you encounter during your research?

 When selecting a library, use the latest available version and clearly specify the
Python version and library version used.
